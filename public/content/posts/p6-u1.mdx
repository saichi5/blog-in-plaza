### Welcome to Boost Note!

Maximize your developer team&apos;s velocity with Boost Note. Here are some workflow examples to help you get set up:

# Agile development teams

With Boost Note folder page, you&apos;ll be able to organize your dev team&apos;s sprint backlog and visualize them with properties such as Person, Date, Status, Time and everything you need.

Customize your team&apos;s properties with name changes, add options and change background color for Status and Label.

Reduce repeated progress updates in the company chat and standup meetings!

# Tech specs

Write overviews of systems including concepts, terminology definitions and description of how these concepts work together.

Having a &apos;living document&apos; with powerful markdown editor to help drive dialogue and exchange of ideas through collaboration helps this process significantly.

# Meeting minutes

Meeting minutes are essential to clarify the following steps after the meetings. Without those, team members can be misunderstood what they talked about during the meeting or forget what to do regarding the topic.


Using calendar view and adding properties can help manage these documents wisely and efficiently access what you want to read.

# Feedback portal

Customer centricity is crucial for agile development.


Is your customer feedback scattered all over HubSpot, Typeform, Intercom, etc? Collect them to turn into actionable items.
